# Session Context

Use this file to track user corrections, additions, and evolving context.
Record provenance so inputs are treated as claims, not facts:
- Source type (open source, proprietary, expert, hearsay)
- Confidence (low, medium, high)
- Corroboration (none, partial, strong)
- Recency (hours, days, weeks)
- What would falsify this?

## Initial Context
