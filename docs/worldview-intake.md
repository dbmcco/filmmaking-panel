# Filmmaking Worldview Intake (Phase 0)

## Purpose

Capture the creator's creative worldview before scenario development. This is the user's
internal model of what the film is, who it is for, and what it must protect.
Focus routing happens only after the worldview is confirmed.

## Outputs

- worldview_model.md
- phase_0_discovery/internal_baseline.md (add focus profile + art/commercial weights)

## Focus Profile (Capture Early)

- Primary focus: writing|production|fundraising|market
- Secondary focus (optional)
- Art weight (0-100)
- Commercial weight (0-100)
- Decision horizon (1-6 months, 6-18 months, 18+ months)
- Non-negotiables (creative + practical)

## Question Bank

### Creative Worldview
- "What truth about people or the world must this story communicate?"
- "What is the emotional promise to the audience?"
- "What would feel like a betrayal of the story?"
- "What is the moral stance of the film, even if it is not stated?"

### Audience Worldview
- "Who is this for, and what do they believe when they walk in?"
- "What do you want them to believe or feel differently by the end?"
- "Which audience assumption are you most eager to challenge?"

### Aesthetic Truth
- "What kind of reality does this film claim: naturalistic, heightened, surreal, stylized?"
- "What is the core cinematic language: sound-driven, image-driven, performance-driven?"
- "What is the minimum production value or aesthetic bar you refuse to drop below?"

### Constraints and Risk
- "What is locked right now (rights, attachments, timeline, budget tier)?"
- "Which constraint is the hardest to accept?"
- "What risk are you willing to take for the story to be true?"

### Focus Routing
- "What decision are you actually trying to make in the next 1-6 months?"
- "If you could only get one thing from this panel, what would it be?"
- "Pick a primary focus and a backup focus."
- "Set your art vs commercial weight (0-100 each)."
