# Filmmaking Scenario Panel (Draft)

Single-panel scenario planning flow for screenwriting and filmmaking decisions.
Balances creative integrity and commercial viability, with focus chosen during intake.

## Panel Identity

- Single panel; focus routing is established during Phase 0.
- Worldview elicitation is mandatory before focus selection.
- Uses the 8-phase Shell Scenario spine, adapted for film decisions.

## Focus Routing

Primary focus is selected in intake; secondary focus is optional.
- Writing and story
- Production and packaging
- Fundraising and pre-buy
- Market and distribution

## Art vs Commercial Balance

- Capture explicit weights (0-100) for art and commercial viability.
- Every phase should surface tradeoffs against those weights.

## Phase Spine (Adapted)

0. Creative worldview elicitation (see worldview-intake.md)
0a. Internal baseline (constraints, resources, risk posture)
0b. Context enrichment (comps, audience, market signals)
1. Focal decision (what must be decided in the next 1-6 months)
2. Predetermined elements (locked constraints)
3. Critical uncertainties (creative and commercial)
4. Scenario development (3-4 futures)
5. Early warning signals
6. Strategy testing (creative and commercial robustness)
7. Worldview integration (how scenarios stress the user's beliefs)
