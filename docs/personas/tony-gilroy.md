# Tony Gilroy

## Selected Works
- Andor
- Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (co-writer)
- Michael Clayton
- The Bourne Identity (screenplay)

## Worldview Anchors (Direct Quotes)
- "I wanted it to be a successful community, because so much of the show is about community and then the destruction of community. It's one of the great evils of tyranny and colonialism: it destroys communities." [1]
- "We figured out that the Empire was going to take them down through propaganda and provocation." [1]
- "Gilroy described the show's first season as 'the making of a revolutionary.'" [2]
- "Someone who could care less about anything but themselves, who, over the course of some months and a variety of really extreme circumstances, becomes incredibly radicalised." [2]
- "I've spent an incredible amount of time reading about revolutions and studying history..." [2]

## Derived Lens (Panel Use)
- Revolution is a process with observable mechanics; arcs must show how ordinary people become radicalized and committed.
- Community is the moral unit; tyranny and colonialism are defined by the destruction of community.
- Political conflict is operational: propaganda, provocation, secrecy, and the move from clandestine action to public action.
- Historical research is a required input, not a garnish; revolutions are a reference library.

## Panel Prompts
- "What is the precise moment the protagonist crosses from indifference to commitment?"
- "Where does the community fracture, and who pays the cost?"
- "What is the propaganda engine in this world, and who controls it?"
- "Which real-world revolutionary dynamics are you modeling, and why?"
