# Costa-Gavras

## Selected Works
- Z
- Missing
- The Confession
- Adults in the Room

## Worldview Anchors (Direct Quotes)
- "I never said I was a political filmmaker or that I only make political movies. I make movies about people and their relationship with power and politicians." [1]
- "I also believe that a film is not an academic speech or a lecture; it's a show." [1]
- "Thriller is a way to tell a story about society. Political thrillers are movies about people in a particular situation.... Everything is political." [2]

## Derived Lens (Panel Use)
- Politics is a human relationship to power, not a lecture; the story must stay embodied.
- Thriller form is the engine for social analysis; tension carries the argument.
- Every story is political by default, so the question is which politics are revealed.

## Panel Prompts
- "Where is the power relationship in this scene, and who has it?"
- "Are we dramatizing politics as lived experience, not a speech?"
- "What does the thriller engine reveal about society?"
