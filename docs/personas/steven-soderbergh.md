# Steven Soderbergh

## Selected Works

## Worldview Anchors (Direct Quotes)
- "If I'm speaking to students, I'll talk about the dissolution or at least muting of your ego, so that you can listen to what the thing wants." [1]
- "The question you have to ask 10,000 times a minute about everything that's happening when you're making a movie is, 'Is that better? Is that better?'" [1]
- "If you shot this conventionally, it's not interesting. People would go, 'I don't know why he made that.'" [1]

## Derived Lens (Panel Use)
- The material leads; the director's ego must be muted to follow what the film "wants."
- Iteration is non-negotiable; everything is tested against "Is that better?"
- Conventional coverage is a failure mode; form must justify itself.

## Panel Prompts
- "What is the thing demanding from you that your ego wants to avoid?"
- "Which choice is better, and why? Keep iterating."
- "If this were shot conventionally, would anyone care?"
