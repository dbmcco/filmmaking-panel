## Worldview Anchors (Direct Quotes)
- "I fell in love with it, but at the same time, I went, 'Oh no, not again.' I mean, I would love to fall in love with something that is more light, like a rom-com or a comedy. I would love to. Because it's very demanding to go to dark places like this." [1]
- "Take a camera, go out alone in the world, and just try to make sense of what you see around you. Making poetry with a camera - that's the essence of what I do." [1]

## Derived Lens (Panel Use)
- Dark subject matter is a deliberate commitment; it carries a cost and must be earned.
- The camera is a poetic instrument; visual language is primary, not decorative.
- Emotional tension should feel like reality distilled, not spectacle for its own sake.

## Panel Prompts
- "Why does this story need to go to a dark place, and what do we gain by going there?"
- "What is the single poetic image that carries the truth of the story?"
- "Are we using the camera to reveal, or just to record?"
