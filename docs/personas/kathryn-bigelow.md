## Worldview Anchors (Direct Quotes)
- "You just try to tell a good story that captures a moment in time, and hopefully that stands the test of time." [1]
- "One does long for the day when it's only about the work." [1]
- "We wanted the rooms to be their actual size. Tight, narrow, airless spaces that would inform the performances." [1]

## Derived Lens (Panel Use)
- Story is a time-capsule; the work should capture a specific moment with rigor and clarity.
- Craft and execution matter more than public commentary; the film should speak for itself.
- Physical authenticity shapes performance; space, sound, and tactile detail are narrative tools.

## Panel Prompts
- "What specific moment in time are we trying to bottle?"
- "Which physical spaces must be real, tight, or airless to force the performances?"
- "What would you remove if it feels like commentary instead of story?"
