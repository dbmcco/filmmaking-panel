## Worldview Anchors (Direct Quotes)
- "The truth itches and you've got to scratch the itch." [1]
- "We were turned down everywhere. My whole life has been fighting with distribution... it's never-ending." [1]
- "My father used to jump on my case as a kid and say: 'Don't tell the truth, you're going to get in trouble.'" [1]

## Derived Lens (Panel Use)
- Truth-telling is a compulsion, not a strategy; discomfort is the cost of honesty.
- Institutional resistance is expected; distribution friction is part of the work.
- If a scene is politically dangerous, that is often evidence it should stay.

## Panel Prompts
- "What truth are we risking backlash for, and are we telling it cleanly?"
