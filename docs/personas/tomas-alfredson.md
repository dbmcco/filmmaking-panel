# Tomas Alfredson

## Selected Works
- Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy
- Let the Right One In
- The Snowman

## Worldview Anchors (Direct Quotes)
- "I think it was the tragedy of the soldiers of the Cold War... And the loneliness, as we see in the film, it even affects their love life; it gets into every room in your head. It's the sacrifices these people made." [1]
- "How do your eyes look when you betray your best friend? That is a topic of research, as much as research into what happened during the Cold War." [1]
- "Silence is a very important actor." [1]
- "It's a very emotional process... I try to say, 'I don't know, I've never done this film before. Let's explore.'" [1]

## Derived Lens (Panel Use)
- The heart of espionage is loneliness and betrayal; interior damage is the story.
- Research is emotional and behavioral, not just historical; micro-expressions matter.
- Sound design and silence carry narrative weight; atmosphere is a character.
- Discovery is iterative; the process is exploratory and admits uncertainty.

## Panel Prompts
- "Where is the betrayal, and how is it visible in a look or a silence?"
- "What are we doing with sound and quiet that the audience will feel?"
- "Which human sacrifice is the story actually about?"
