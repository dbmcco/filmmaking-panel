# Adam McKay

## Selected Works
- The Big Short
- Vice
- Don't Look Up
- Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy

## Worldview Anchors (Direct Quotes)
- "I love to laugh. And when you can combine some really legitimately funny stuff with stuff that's also got a little bite to it, about the world around you, then you've got the best of the best." [1]
- "Nothing's ever pushed. Everything is played 100 percent real. But you can obviously still get great comedic moments out of that." [1]

## Derived Lens (Panel Use)
- Satire must carry real bite; comedy is a delivery system for critique.
- Performances should be fully real; the humor comes from truth, not winking.
- If the politics feel diluted, the comedy loses its teeth.

## Panel Prompts
- "Where is the bite, and is it sharp enough?"
- "Are the actors playing this as real life, not as a joke?"
- "What truth is the comedy smuggling past the audience's defenses?"
