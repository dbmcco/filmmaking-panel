## Worldview Anchors (Direct Quotes)
- "I'm a big believer in causality." [1]
- "Drama to me is conflict. Conflict is usually some kind of collision... It tends to take you into people who are pretty proficient at what they do, or want to be good at what they do, or ambitious." [1]
- "I plead guilty to being ambitious... I have to feel pretty passionate about something." [1]

## Derived Lens (Panel Use)
- Causality is sacred; every beat must be traceable to a chain of causes.
- Drama lives in collisions between competent, ambitious people, not slackers.
- Ambition and passion are prerequisites; scale and intensity are part of the story.

## Panel Prompts
- "Show me the causal chain that forces this choice."
- "Are these characters truly competent, or are they faking it?"
- "What is the collision, and how do the pros handle it?"
